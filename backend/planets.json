However, Mercury rotates very slowly, taking 59 Earth days to complete one rotation, while it takes just 88 Earth days to orbit the Sun. This results in extreme temperature variations, with daytime temperatures soaring to over 427 degrees Celsius and dropping to nearly -201 degrees Celsius at night."

Venus has an atmosphere with 90 times the pressure of Earth's, composed mainly of carbon dioxide and thick clouds of sulfuric acid. This results in a runaway greenhouse effect, making Venus the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures exceeding 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius)."

Mars is also home to the longest canyon, Valles Marineris, stretching over 4000 kilometres. Since the late 20th century, Mars has been explored by numerous uncrewed spacecraft and rovers, and as of 2023, over 11 active probes are studying the planet. While Mars remains a key target for future human missions, none are currently planned."

Pluto has five known moons, with Charon being the largest, and they are so big compared to Pluto that they almost look like a double planet. In 2006, Pluto was reclassified from a planet to a dwarf planet because it doesn’t clear its orbit of other objects like the eight major planets do. "
